I edited a website for the Horiseon company and attempted to make the website more accessible. I added semantic html elements, a clear and concise title, correct heading hierarchy and a fixed position for the navigation bar at the top of the screen.

## Installation 
Open the website in the browser via the GitHub pages link in the Repo.

## Usage
Website is mostly similiar to before.
